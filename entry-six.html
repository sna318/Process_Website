        <h2>March 4, 2024: Demo Day</h2>

        <h3>Demo Day Materials</h3>
        <p>
          For Demo Day, I printed the Pip cards in the Minor Arcana, as well as
          a description booklet for those cards. I had to work quickly this week
          in order to accommodate the print turnaround time at Brooklyn’s
          Minuteman Press, which is actually really fast. I had a great time
          working with them and highly recommend their services.
        </p>

        <p>
          I learned a few things about prepping print files, specifically with
          border widths to account for card-cutting error. I think it’s really
          nice to see all the cards laid out together, since one of the things I
          was most worried about was making sure they looked like they belonged
          in the same deck. Content-wise for the booklet, I had to trim down a
          lot of info to make it more digestible and easy to scan, since I
          primarily want readers to trust their own interpretation of the cards
          first. While I wasn’t able to present all 78 cards, I think this
          assortment will give a good idea of the aesthetic I’m going for, as
          well as the narrative key system I have in place with the seven types
          of hand gestures.
        </p>

        <h3>Feedback from After the Show Activity</h3>
        <p>
          The After the Show activity was really helpful for anticipating
          questions I may get on Demo Day. I think overall, the audience will
          have a good idea of what my deck aims to accomplish. The three spirits
          in this activity were able to identify that the cards facilitate a
          tarot learning experience, particularly for young adults, by using
          clear imagery and an open-ended narrative system.
        </p>
        <p>
          The visitors in this activity asked some useful questions that I need
          to consider for Demo Day. Some of them include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Why do tarot decks need updating?</li>
          <li>How does this project expand on existing decks?</li>
          <li>
            What might an advanced tarot reader like about my deck and learning
            materials?
          </li>
          <li>
            How might a digital or technology component assist tarot readers?
          </li>
          <li>
            How will I be leading a tarot reading activity for the final
            showcase?
          </li>
          <li>How can I share more info about the tarot production process?</li>
        </ul>
