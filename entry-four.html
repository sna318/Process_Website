        <h1>Thesis Weekly Update #4</h1>
        <h2>February 19, 2024: Progress presentation</h2>

        <h3>Midterm Demo Day Plans</h3>
        <p>
          For the midterm demo day, I’ll be showcasing print versions of several
          cards from the Minor Arcana (at least 5 from each of the 4 suits).
          They’ll be printed from a local shop as opposed to a card
          manufacturer, just for easy access for iterating on the prints. I’ll
          cut out the rounded card corners myself for this demo. In addition,
          I’ll have a print booklet of the card descriptions for the ones I’ll
          have available, as well as rules and instructions for learning to read
          with the hand rule system.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think my biggest challenge will be getting the prints done in time.
          I need to wrap up several of the Swords cards, then reformat them
          properly in Photoshop to the right color space and text, which
          requires me to plan in advance. In addition, I think it'd be a good
          idea to have some visual representation of my design process for the
          cards, since it's been so non-linear. However, I'm not entirely sure
          what the best medium for this would be for Demo Day.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think having these two materials will allow an audience to have
          baseline interaction with the cards. They should suffice to form
          simple layouts, such as a standard Past-Present-Future reading. I also
          think this is a good opportunity to have feedback on the Minor Arcana
          cards, since they tend to be more difficult for novice readers to
          learn. I think faculty members will have feedback on ways of improving
          how I teach the hand rule system, either within the booklet or by
          other means (e.g. content for my future video or a website). I also
          anticipate feedback on how well the cards’ imagery matches the
          narrative within the booklet.
        </p>
        <h3>Meeting with Sam</h3>
        <p>
          I met with Sam last week to discuss my presentation for the Thesis
          Showcase. I’m hoping to create a little psychic shop stand within the
          classroom that’s hosting all the physical project showcases. This will
          include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A round table with velvet tablecloth, lights, and crystal ball.
            Cards and booklet will be available here.
          </li>
          <li>
            Two chairs for audience members to switch being reader and querent.
          </li>
          <li>
            A short activity for audience members to engage in a reading
            together (maybe have a QR code available for multiple reading
            options)
          </li>
          <li>
            Create a poster (which can be in the room with me or elsewhere on
            campus) - detailing my project and sample activities
          </li>
          <li>
            Film a psychic commercial or how-to reading, which I’d send to Sam
          </li>
          <li>
            Print large signs for the psychic shop, which can be done at the IDM
            Print Lab
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I’ll be visiting the space with Sam on Wednesday to get a sense of
          what my options are. I’m also entertaining an open-tent setup for this
          psychic shop, just so it doesn’t feel like a simple stall in a
          classroom.
        </p>
        <p>
          The poster I’ll be sending to Sam needs to be 24”x36” at a high
          resolution. I can upload the poster file on the IDM Thesis Showcase
          form or send it to Sam directly.
        </p>
        <h3>Project Updates</h3>
        <p>
          This week, I continued drawing and coloring the cards, specifically
          for the Wands suit. In addition, I arrived at a set of meanings for
          the seven types of gestures featured across all the cards. Lastly, I
          took some time to map out what my design process has been at different
          stages, since it’s definitely been non-linear.
