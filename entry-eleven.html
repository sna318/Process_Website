        <h2>April 15, 2024: Production work</h2>

        <h3>Project Updates</h3>
        <p>This week, I continued refining the design of my cards, including the remaining 4 Swords cards and some revisions to cards in the Cups and Pentacles, which I originally designed prior to developing the hand gesture system. I’ve been in contact with Graphic Lab Printing NYC and plan to have 5 decks of the 40 Minor Arcana cards printed with them next week. They’re based in Long Island and anticipate shipping to take 1-2 days, though I can also stop by their shop in person if anything goes wrong.</p>

        <p>In addition, I’ve begun revising the beginning section of my narrative booklet to include instructions for how to read tarot with my system and how to use the worksheet to guide a 3-card predictive reading.</p>

        <p>I’ve focused my time these past few days working on the paper as well. I did most of my work on the primary research section, additional research from existing tarot reading books, and my design process. I plan to write the introduction and abstract after my other sections are completed. I’m also in pre production for the commercial I’m filming next week and am hoping to have a cut of it done by the first week of May.</p>
        
        <p>The last thing I need to focus more on is the content and structure of the fundraiser page, which I want to be available in time for the showcase. I think I might do it on either Backerkit or Indiegogo, the latter which I have experience with from previous fundraisers. The next few weeks will be busy for sure, but I feel good about the timeline!</p>
