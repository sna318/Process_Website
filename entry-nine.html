        <h2>April 1, 2024: Project Documentation Peer Review</h2>
        <h3>Relevant Focus Areas</h3>
        <p>
          In the remainder of the semester, I’ll be focusing more on developing
          the learning scaffold for novice tarot readers performing a simple
          3-card predictive reading. I spent this week focusing on the
          step-by-step approach for this scaffold, which will be an activity
          between two people who take turns reading for each other. In the final
          version, the activity would be formatted with these instructions:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Before they start: Both participants watch a brief 30-60s video of a sample predictive tarot reading to know what to expect and how a reading may be conducted.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reader asks the querent to come up with an open-ended question
            they’d like to know the outcome of.
          </li>
          <li>
            Querent thinks of their question. Reader writes down the question on
            the worksheet.
          </li>
          <li>Reader has querent knock on the top of the deck three times.</li>
          <li>
            Reader asks querent to provide some more context about their
            inquiry, why they’d like to know the outcomes, and how they’re
            feeling about the situation AS they (reader) shuffle the deck.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reader has 2 options: fan the deck out in a straight line OR split
            the deck into 3 piles.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reader pulls three cards and situates them in a row: leftmost Past,
            middle Present, rightmost Future. The cards should all be face down.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reader flips over each card from left to right. Take a moment to
            observe the cards and note your own reactions.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the worksheet, reader writes the names of all 3 cards and marks
            the 3 hand gestures they observe. Reader may use the bottom yellow
            space to track their own notes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reader tells the narrative they’re observing, using the hand gesture
            keys and their own interpretation of the imagery. ***Be sure to go
            one card at a time*** - Past card first, Present card second, Future
            card third.
          </li>
          <li>
            Allow input from querent, such as their reactions or any follow-up
            questions they have.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reader can now flip to the relevant description pages in the
            booklet. On the worksheet, fill out the keywords from the booklet
            (or substitute with your own). Reader may add more notes to the
            bottom yellow space.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reader provides more context or fills in any gaps that the querent
            identified.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reader concludes the reading. Organize the cards back into a single
            pile and have the querent knock on the top of the deck to clear its
            energy. Thank the querent for participating in the reading.
          </li>
          <li>Now switch! Return to step 2.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>I’ll be playtesting with people over the next two weeks. Five participants reached out expressing interest to playtest, one of whom was an expert that I interviewed last semester. In addition I’ll be playtesting on Thursday at NYU. </p>

        <h3>Paper Approach</h3>
        <p>In addition to working on the learning scaffold, I’ve been chipping away at my process paper. I plan to follow this structure:</p>

        </ol>

            <p>I met with Professor Piantella last week to get some feedback on my thesis progress and any resources that would be helpful for literature review. She suggested looking into scaffolding models of learning and cognitive science literature. Some examples of topics to look at are information processing models, apprenticeship learning systems, experiential learning, assimilation theory, principles in multimedia design, coherence theory, signaling principle, and Mayer’s principles (specifically personalization, pre-training, and contiguity).</p>

            <p>I think I may have the most trouble interweaving secondary research effectively. I discussed this with Professor Piantella and she recommended having sub sections in my background research for tarot and learning design. And then I could reference back to my learning design citations in later sections of the process paper, especially in the instructional guidance section. </p>

            <p>I’m a little nervous about having the final version of my cards ready before I print them. I will probably do it locally in NYC, because I might not have enough turnaround time for longer distance shipping if I’m playtesting this week and next. I think it will all work out though!</p>
