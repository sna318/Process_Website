        <h3>Faculty Feedback</h3>

        <h4>Accessible Card Design Feedback</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Check that the text font is readable - there are camera checkers for
            accessibility, look into Seeing AI
          </li>
          <li>
            Check that there is good color contrast in the imagery (quality of
            printing paper impacts color saturation)
          </li>
          <li>Make the cards tactile - look into embossing</li>
          <li>
            Add a notch to the back of the cards so users immediately know which
            one is right side up
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Digital Component Feedback</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Add QR codes to card so booklet descriptions can exist on the web -
            make screen reader accessible
          </li>
          <li>
            Make visual description of card imagery more distinct - maybe put
            this separately before the narrative
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Videos Feedback</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Helpful for learning how to read cards in layouts</li>
          <li>They should be 30-60 seconds long max</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Future Presentation / Thesis Showcase Feedback</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Create a poster with the card imagery to draw audience in - set up
            on an easel
          </li>
          <li>Highlight 5-7 key unique value proposition of my card deck</li>
          <li>
            Emphasize the learning design approach to my tarot card design, as
            well as the unique value of a user-empathy, narrative-driven
            approach to learning what each card means
          </li>
          <li>
            Have audience members read for each other as opposed to me reading
            for them first
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>My Reflections</h3>
        <p>
          My main objective is to make tarot reading more approachable for
          novice readers. I want to go about this by designing cards and
          descriptions that empower the reader to draw from their own intuition
          when reading for a querent. I believe that the more a reader can trust
          their intuition, the more readily they can dive into giving solid
          readings for other people. Additionally, the act of reading for others
          will help readers memorize the cards faster. I think of it as a
          two-way street: you can only really get better at reading tarot if you
          consistently read for others (or yourself); but to achieve the
          confidence to read for others, you need the learning experience of to
          be scaffolded well. The learning scaffold itself is two-fold as well:
          gaining familiarity of each card’s meaning and building a narrative
          from cards in layouts. So to empower novice readers to give readings
          for others on the get go, I want to hold their hand more with that
          learning scaffold. My core solution is to (1) swap out prescriptive
          card meanings with brief narratives that situate the user within the
          literal card and (2) create a shorthand key system of hand gestures
          that impart actionable takeaways from each card.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel confident about the direction of my materials so far. I’m
          aiming to have all the cards done, but I personally care more about
          the Minor Arcana, since those cards tend to be harder to learn. I’m
          drawing these insights from the interviews I conducted last semester,
          though I’m hoping to find more literature to back my claims. I really
          like the idea of making the cards more accessible, specifically with
          adding the notch for right-side up readings and double checking text
          readability and image color contrast. I was thinking of having a
          screen-reader accessible PDF version of the booklet available online
          in lieu of a website, just because I want to dedicate more time to the
          cards and learning experience. If I go the website route, it would
          essentially be a version of the booklet that also includes visual
          descriptions of the cards. The website could also be a place for me to
          host my quick 30-60 second videos of how-to-do-readings, but I was
          also considering posting them on an Instagram page. There’s also the
          option of creating a website to advertise the card deck, but that will
          come after everything else.
        </p>
        <p>
          I definitely want to focus on onboarding novice readers to do tarot
          readings with little to no prior knowledge. In addition to having the
          booklet available, I think I’ll print out a “cheat sheet” with the
          seven different hand gestures and what the key message for each one
          is. That way, if readers struggle to surmount the step between
          describing what the individual card means to how it answers the
          querent’s question, they can glance at the sheet for guidance. I also
          want to break down the steps of giving a reading and will likely rely
          on my own methods, as well as the methods followed by my expert
          interviewees. For live demos, I envision this as a numbered list of
          instructions (similar to the slide I had up during Demo Day), but I
          want to explore other options as well. For those who are learning
          independently, I would have those quick videos of sample readings
          available.
