        <p>
          During Demo Day, I offered a tarot reading for the faculty reviewing
          my project. The three faculty members each drew a card for the
          Past/Present/Future 3-card layout. While this wasn’t a typical querent
          reading, which is typically 1 reader and 1 querent, I thought it was a
          fun exercise to include everyone in the reading. I thought that they
          became more interested in the reading when we reached the 2 of Swords
          in the Future placement, as the card is a good example of how a
          reader’s intuition can influence the interpretation of a layout. I
          also felt that it was an organic way to demonstrate how novice readers
          can refer back to the booklet if they need a helping hand. While I
          thought the reading went okay, I didn’t get to fully convey the
          instructional design piece that has driven my work thus far. In the
          future, I’m hoping to open up my presentation with this lens and
          demonstrate how I’m using tarot as a case study of how learning design
          can enhance user engagement with card games.
        </p>

        <p>
          The feedback I received from Demo Day was very helpful and has helped
          me narrow down what I’d like to focus on in the upcoming weeks. For
          the remainder of the semester, I will be focusing on developing a
          solid instructional guide for how novice readers can immediately read
          tarot in a layout. I’m deciding to do this, as opposed to drawing the
          remaining Major Arcana and Court cards, because a large aspect of
          learning tarot is learning by doing, which means learning by reading
          the cards regularly. If I can get novice readers to feel comfortable
          reading for others from the get go, then I will be hitting learning
          goals like independent interpretation and narrative storytelling. My
          hope is that this will shift learners away from rote memorization,
          which has been a significant barrier to mastering tarot.
        </p>

        <p>
          After I have a working prototype of the instructional guide, I will be
          playtesting the cards and guide with people who have little to no
          experience reading tarot. I will use feedback to refine the guide and
          to assess other areas for improving the cards, especially for cards
          where the symbolism isn’t effective. In addition, I will be updating
          the fonts of the cards’ names to be more readable and refining the
          color palette to boost visual contrast. For the paper itself, I’ve
          gone through most of my process thus far and have added to literature
          for secondary research. I’m hoping to be in a good place to have a
          complete draft by our late April deadline.

        <h3>Tarot Reading Instructional Guidance</h3>
        <p>
          As I was researching instructional design theories, I came across the
          ADDIE Framework, which is very helpful with designing course content.
          I decided to use this framework to pinpoint the exact reading workflow
          I'd like novice learners to go through, as well as the specific
          materials they'd find helpful. I jotted down my ideas for each phase
          of this framework: Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and
          Evaluation. This was super helpful for considering what I want novice
          learners to take away from this exercise, while also taking note of
          the skillsets they already bring to the table, as well as areas they
          may need more granular guidance on. By taking the time to walk through
          this framework, I realize that I will need to film a few short reading
          videos earlier on before I playtest this entire exercise.
          Additionally, I would like to design a simple 1-page worksheet that
          will walk readers through the individual steps of noticing and
          building a narrative from a standard 3-card Past/Present/Future
          reading.
