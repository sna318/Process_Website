        <h3>Group Feedback Notes on Preliminary Prototype</h3>
        <p>
          For the preliminary prototype presentation, I shared printouts for
          several colored cards in the Pentacles suit. The feedback I received
          from my classmates were:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Completely write out the names of each card to help beginners
            completely unfamiliar with Tarot
          </li>
          <li>
            Minimize the color saturation of the cards; incorporate texture to
            reduce flatness
          </li>
          <li>
            If adding a web component - explore ways of presenting one card in a
            digitally creative way; can use the layers from Procreate and
            Photoshop to create holistic, interactive, immersive ways of reading
            the card; explore no code options
          </li>
          <li>
            Like the similar elements even if there’s no set color palette
          </li>
          <li>
            Each card’s hand gesture is different - maybe standardizing them in
            some way can help with audience understanding meaning behind each
            card
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>One-on-one Meeting Notes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            People in class seemed already drawn to the imagery of the Pentacles
            suit and were able to generate preliminary interpretations without
            prior knowledge of Tarot.
          </li>
          <li>
            I should spend time developing the rule system for reading my cards,
            along with the content of my description booklet.
          </li>
          <li>
            My booklet containing each card’s description can benefit from a
            narrative approach, meaning there wouldn’t be a prescriptive list of
            what the card traditionally means, but it describes the story of the
            card and key considerations or perspectives for the reader to take
            away.
          </li>
          <li>
            I should consider experience design as a core component of the
            thesis showcase. I would love to have my audience use the tarot deck
            in some way, so setting up a reading table could be the way to go.
            We also discussed a video component to draw the audience in and
            learn about Tarot.
          </li>
          <li>
            The website might not be the best direction to go in (unless it
            serves more to promote a funds campaign for the tarot deck). Going
            back to my interview notes, it may be helpful to set up a website or
            social media page with short videos of how to do querent readings
            with my cards.
          </li>
          <li>
            I should look into conferences for presenting my research-based
            Tarot deck. ACM Hypertext could be promising, as well as conferences
            in the art and game world.
          </li>
          <li>
            For fundraising, I could consider Backerkit or Kickstarter instead
            of Etsy.
          </li>
          <li>
            IRB approval for my project is still pending, which can influence
            the timeline and scope of a diary study. I absolutely want the diary
            study to happen, as it would help me understand the learning journey
            process with my deck. Considering the amount of time it takes to
            produce each card, however, I may end up sending the suits only or
            just a handful of cards from each arcana and suit for variation. If
            the IRB doesn’t pan out, I can try playtesting sessions on campus.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ideas for Showcase</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Create a psychic shop setup (or a similar ambiance). Must include a
            table and two chairs - audience take turns being the reader and
            querent with the Perspective Tarot Deck
          </li>
          <li>
            Projecting a continuous looping video - perhaps a fun and weird
            commercial for the crowdsourcing
          </li>
          <li>
            QR code to scan to website with additional tarot learning (likely
            video compilations for how to read tarot spreads)
          </li>
          <li>Creating a website to crowdsource funds to produce more decks</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Progress Updates</h3>
        <p>
          This week, I worked on sketching more tarot cards for the Major
          Arcana. These cards will continue to have the same first-person POV
          imagery. I’m hoping to have a few cards from each suit and arcana for
          a form of user testing, whether that be the diary study or through
          anonymized playtesting sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, I added textures to the imagery of the Cups suit to add
          more dimension. Overall, I like the aesthetic of this much more, as it
          retains the simplicity of the imagery (suited for learning), while not
          being too flat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, I’ve been working on developing a rule system for reading the
          cards, inspired by I Ching. I’m working on this on Google Sheets,
          where I have working copy for each card’s description, as well as
          terminology for what each hand gesture represents. I’m also hoping
          that sticking to a fixed set of hand gestures will optimize the time
          spent on designing each card. The only key difference would be the
          Court Cards, which will depict actual characters from the reader’s
          perspective. To keep with the hands theme, I’m hoping to have their
          hand gestures feature prominently on the cards.
        </p>
